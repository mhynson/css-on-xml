# css-on-xml
A basic demo to showcase using CSS to style an XML document.

## Why?
I noticed someone mention using CSS and XML. While I knew that I could be done, I've never done it myself, so I put together a small demo just to see it in action and try it out.

## Process
- Pull some placeholder JSON from here - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com into VS Code
- Wrote some regex to change the JSON to XML
- Ran the XML through a validator to check my work
- Wrote some basic styles to add the css to the XML document
- Tweaked styles from there with a focus on responsive design and CSS grid box

## How to Demo Locally
- Clone the repo
- Open up the XML file in your browser
- Enjoy!
